# CodingQuiz_AKK

This is a Javascript coding quiz which utilizes Local Storage to record recent scores from users. Questions are generated from an array, which is then cycled through and the users answers to these questions will be selected via select buttons.

Correct answers will provide the user with an additional point, out of a total of 7 questions. However, a incorrect answer will deduct 5 seconds from the timer. This timer only has 75 seconds, so the user is pressed to be accurate while simultaneously effecient.

Upon completion of this quiz, the user will have the opportunity to enter their intials into a highscore page on the push of the submit button, displaying their game and identity information, encouraging positive competition among fellow programmers.


The last step is for the user to decide whether they would like to restart the quiz, with another selct butoon with the option to clear the previous highscores.
